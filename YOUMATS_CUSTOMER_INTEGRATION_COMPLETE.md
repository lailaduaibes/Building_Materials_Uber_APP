# 🚀 **YouMats Driver App + Customer App Notification Integration**

## ✅ **Integration Complete!**

The YouMats driver app has been successfully integrated with your customer app's enhanced notification system. Here's what's now working:

### 🔄 **Real-time Notification Flow**

#### **Customer Experience:**
1. **Books Trip** → Gets confirmation
2. **Driver Assigned** → "Driver John has been assigned to your delivery"
3. **Driver En Route to Pickup** → "John is heading to pickup your materials"
4. **Driver Arrived at Pickup** → "John has arrived at pickup location"
5. **Materials Loaded** → "Materials loaded! John is heading to your location"
6. **Driver En Route to Delivery** → "John is on the way to your location"
7. **Driver Arriving** → "John is arriving in 2-3 minutes"
8. **Delivery Complete** → "Your materials have been delivered!"

#### **Driver Experience:**
1. **Accepts Trip** → Customer gets notification
2. **Updates Status** → Customer gets real-time updates
3. **Sends Messages** → Customer receives driver messages
4. **Updates ETA** → Customer gets delay notifications

## 🎯 **How It Works in Production**

### **1. Driver Status Updates**
```typescript
// When driver clicks "Start Trip"
await driverService.updateTripStatus(tripId, 'start_trip');
// ↓ Automatically triggers customer notification:
// "John is heading to pickup your materials"
```

### **2. Arrival Notifications**
```typescript
// When driver clicks "Arrived at Pickup"
await driverService.sendArrivalNotification(tripId, 'pickup');
// ↓ Customer receives:
// "John has arrived at pickup location and is loading materials"
```

### **3. Custom Messages**
```typescript
// Driver sends custom message
await driverService.sendMessageToCustomer(tripId, "Running 5 minutes late due to traffic");
// ↓ Customer receives:
// "Message from John: Running 5 minutes late due to traffic"
```

### **4. ETA Updates**
```typescript
// Driver updates ETA
await driverService.sendETAUpdate(tripId, 15, "Heavy traffic");
// ↓ Customer receives:
// "Your delivery is running 15 minutes late due to Heavy traffic"
```

| Driver Action | Customer Notification | Type |
|---------------|----------------------|------|
| Accepts Trip | "Driver assigned" | `status_update` |
| Starts Trip | "Driver en route to pickup" | `status_update` |

## 🔗 **Database Integration**

Both apps now use the same **`notifications` table**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE notifications (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  trip_id UUID REFERENCES trip_requests(id),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  type TEXT CHECK (type IN ('status_update', 'eta_update', 'arrival', 'driver_message', 'general')),
  data JSONB,
  read_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Real-time subscriptions work across both apps:**
- Customer app subscribes to their user notifications
- Driver actions instantly appear in customer app
- No polling needed - pure real-time updates
