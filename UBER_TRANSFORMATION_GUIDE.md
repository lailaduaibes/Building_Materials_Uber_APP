## ðŸ“‹ TESTING CHECKLIST

### Database Setup
- [ ] Run uber-style-database-schema.sql in Supabase
- [ ] Verify truck_types table has sample data
- [ ] Test RLS policies work correctly
- [ ] Confirm user registration creates customer user_type

### App Functionality
- [ ] Request Truck screen loads truck types
- [ ] Price calculation works with dummy coordinates
- [ ] Trip creation saves to trip_requests table
- [ ] Navigation between screens works
- [ ] Authentication still functions correctly

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Create test trip request
- [ ] Verify trip appears in database
- [ ] Test trip status updates
- [ ] Confirm real-time subscriptions work

## ðŸš€ LAUNCH REQUIREMENTS

### Phase 1: Basic Functionality (Current)
- âœ… Trip request creation
- âœ… Basic truck type selection
- âœ… Price estimation
- âœ… Supabase integration

### Phase 2: Driver Matching
- [ ] Driver registration and verification
- [ ] Automatic driver assignment
- [ ] Driver acceptance/rejection system
- [ ] Real-time location tracking

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
