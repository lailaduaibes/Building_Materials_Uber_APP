-- üß™ Test ASAP Sequential Driver Assignment Fix
-- This verifies that only the assigned driver gets the trip notification

-- ===========================
-- SETUP: Ensure clean state
-- ===========================

-- Clear any existing ASAP trips
UPDATE trip_requests 
SET status = 'cancelled' 
WHERE pickup_time_preference = 'asap' 
  AND status = 'pending';

-- ===========================
-- TEST 1: Create ASAP trip (NO assignment yet)
-- ===========================

-- Customer creates ASAP trip (assigned_driver_id = NULL)
INSERT INTO trip_requests (
    customer_id,
    pickup_latitude,
    pickup_longitude,
    pickup_address,
    dropoff_latitude,
    dropoff_longitude,
    dropoff_address,
    pickup_time_preference,
    assigned_driver_id,
    status,
    created_at
) VALUES (
    'f5e8c6d4-8f2a-4b5c-9e7d-1a3b2c4d5e6f', -- Customer ID
    40.7128, -74.0060, 'Times Square, New York, NY',  -- Pickup
    40.7580, -73.9855, 'Central Park, New York, NY',  -- Dropoff  
    'asap',
    NULL, -- ‚ùó NO driver assigned yet
    'pending',
    NOW()
) RETURNING id, assigned_driver_id, status;

-- At this point: NO driver should receive notification
-- Because filter requires: assigned_driver_id=eq.${currentDriver.user_id}

-- ===========================
-- TEST 2: Assign to specific driver
-- ===========================

-- Get the trip ID
SET @trip_id = (SELECT id FROM trip_requests WHERE pickup_time_preference = 'asap' AND status = 'pending' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1);

-- Get a real driver ID
SET @driver_id = (

    FROM driver_profiles 
    WHERE is_approved = true 
      AND approval_status = 'approved'
    ORDER BY created_at 
    LIMIT 1
);

-- Assign trip to specific driver (this should trigger notification)
UPDATE trip_requests 
SET 
    assigned_driver_id = @driver_id,
    acceptance_deadline = NOW() + INTERVAL '15 seconds'
WHERE id = @trip_id;

-- ===========================
-- VERIFICATION: Check assignment
-- ===========================

-- ===========================
-- TEST 3: Simulate driver decline (assign to next driver)
-- ===========================

-- Get next available driver

    WHERE is_approved = true 
      AND approval_status = 'approved'

-- FINAL VERIFICATION
-- ===========================

-- ===========================
-- CHECK: No multiple simultaneous assignments
-- ===========================

    COUNT(DISTINCT assigned_driver_id) as unique_drivers,

-- ===========================
-- EXPECTED RESULTS:
-- ===========================

/* 
üéØ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER FIX:

1. ‚úÖ Trip created with assigned_driver_id = NULL
   ‚Üí NO driver gets notification (filter prevents it)

2. ‚úÖ Trip assigned to Driver A  
   ‚Üí ONLY Driver A gets notification

3. ‚úÖ Driver A declines, assigned to Driver B
   ‚Üí ONLY Driver B gets notification  

4. ‚úÖ Only ONE active notification at a time
   ‚Üí Sequential assignment confirmed

üö® OLD BROKEN BEHAVIOR (should NOT happen):
- All drivers get notification simultaneously
- Multiple active notifications for same trip
