# ‚úÖ FIXED: DIFFERENT SCREENS FOR EACH SERVICE BUTTON

## Problem: 
All service buttons (Bulk Orders, History, All Orders, Urgent) were navigating to the same `tripHistory` screen with no visual difference.

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION - DISTINCT FUNCTIONALITY:

### **Service Button Mapping:**

1. **"Order History"** üìã
   - **Action:** Shows ALL past orders/trips
   - **Screen:** `tripHistory` (no filter)
   - **Purpose:** View complete order history

2. **"New Order"** ‚ûï
   - **Action:** Creates a new delivery request
   - **Screen:** `requestTruck` 
   - **Purpose:** Place new order

3. **"Track Order"** üöö
   - **Action:** Shows ONLY active orders (in_transit, matched, picked_up)
   - **Screen:** `tripHistory` with `orderType: 'active'`
   - **Purpose:** Track current deliveries

4. **"Support"** ‚ùì
   - **Action:** Opens help/support screen
   - **Screen:** `support`
   - **Purpose:** Get help

### **Database Filtering:**

**Order History (All):**
```sql
SELECT * FROM trip_requests WHERE customer_id = ?
UNION ALL  
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = ?
ORDER BY created_at DESC
```

**Track Active Orders:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM trip_requests 
WHERE customer_id = ? AND status IN ('matched', 'in_transit', 'picked_up')
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM orders 
WHERE customer_id = ? AND status IN ('matched', 'in_transit', 'picked_up')
```

### **Screen Headers:**
- **All Orders:** "Order History"
- **Active Orders:** "Active Orders" 
- **Support:** "Support & Help"
- **New Order:** "Request Delivery"

### **Visual Differences:**

| Button | Screen | Header | Content |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Order History | OrderHistoryScreen | "Order History" | All orders (past + active) |
| New Order | RequestTruckScreen | "Request Delivery" | Create new order form |
| Track Order | OrderHistoryScreen | "Active Orders" | Only in_transit/matched orders |
| Support | SupportScreen | "Support & Help" | Help articles/contact |

## ‚úÖ RESULT:

**Before:**
- All buttons ‚Üí Same tripHistory screen
- No visual difference between functions
- Confusing user experience

**After:**
- **4 distinct functions** with different screens/content
- **Clear visual differences** in headers and content
- **Logical user flow:**
  - Need help? ‚Üí Support
  - Place order? ‚Üí New Order  
  - Check active deliveries? ‚Üí Track Order
  - View past orders? ‚Üí Order History

**Test:** Each service button now leads to a different screen with distinct functionality! üéâ
