# Duplicate User Error Fix Summary

## The Problem
When users are deleted from Supabase Authentication but remain in the custom `users` table, it causes a "duplicate key value violates unique constraint 'user_email_key'" error on re-registration.

## What Happens:

### Normal Flow:
1. User registers → Created in both Supabase Auth + Custom table ✅
2. User uses app normally ✅

### Problem Flow:
1. User registers → Created in both Supabase Auth + Custom table ✅
2. **Admin deletes user from Supabase Auth** (through dashboard) ❌
3. Custom table still has the user record ⚠️
4. User tries to register again with same email:
   - Supabase Auth: ✅ Allows (email is free)
   - Custom table: ❌ Fails (email already exists)

## Solutions Implemented:

### 1. Automatic Cleanup in AuthService
Updated `ensureUserInCustomTable()` method to:
- Detect orphaned users (same email, different ID)
- Automatically delete orphaned records
- Create new user record with correct Supabase Auth ID

### 2. Manual Cleanup Script
Created `cleanup-orphaned-user.js` for manual fixes:
```bash
node cleanup-orphaned-user.js user@example.com
```

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Better duplicate detection
- Graceful handling of race conditions
- Detailed logging for debugging

## How to Fix Current Issues:

### For Specific Email:
```bash
cd "d:\Building Materials Uber App\CustomerAppNew"
node cleanup-orphaned-user.js problematic-email@example.com
```

### For Testing:
Use unique emails to avoid conflicts:
- `test+1@example.com`
- `test+timestamp@example.com`
- `yourname+test@gmail.com`

## Prevention:

### Don't Delete Users From Supabase Auth Dashboard
If you need to remove a user:
1. Deactivate them: Set `is_active = false` in custom table
2. Or use proper user management through the app
3. Avoid direct deletion from Supabase Auth dashboard

### For Development/Testing:
- Use temporary emails
- Clear both Supabase Auth AND custom table together
- Use the cleanup scripts regularly

## Key Files Updated:
- `AuthServiceSupabase.ts` - Automatic orphan cleanup
- `cleanup-orphaned-user.js` - Manual cleanup tool
- `cleanup-duplicate-users.js` - General diagnostic tool

## Testing:
1. Try registering with a fresh email ✅
2. If you get duplicate error, run cleanup script ✅
3. Try registering again ✅

The system now automatically handles most orphaned user scenarios during registration.
