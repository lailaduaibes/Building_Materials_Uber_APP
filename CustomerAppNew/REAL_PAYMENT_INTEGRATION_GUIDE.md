## Required Setup Steps

### 1. Database Setup
Run the migration in your Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
-- Run the contents of database/payment_methods_migration.sql
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Add these to your environment:
```bash
# Stripe Keys (get from stripe.com dashboard)
EXPO_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_publishable_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key

# Backend API URL
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install @stripe/stripe-js
npm install @stripe/react-stripe-js
```

### 4. Backend API Endpoints Needed
You'll need to create these endpoints in your backend:

#### POST /api/payment/add-card
```typescript
// Create Stripe payment method and return stripe_payment_method_id
```

#### DELETE /api/payment/remove-card
```typescript
// Detach payment method from Stripe
```

#### POST /api/payment/process
```typescript
// Process payment using Stripe payment intent
```

## Features Available

- Add PayPal payment methods
- Set default payment method
- Remove payment methods
- Real-time payment method loading
- Modern UI with professional styling
- Security notices and validation

### ðŸ”„ Backend Integration Required
- **Stripe Payment Processing**: Need backend endpoints for card processing
- **PayPal Integration**: Need PayPal SDK integration
- **Transaction History**: Track payment transactions

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. Test Payment Method Addition
- Navigate to Settings â†’ Payment Methods
- Click "Add" button
- Choose between Card or PayPal
- Fill out the form with test data
- Verify validation and submission

### 2. Test Payment Method Management
- Set payment methods as default
- Remove payment methods
- Verify database updates

### 3. Test Stripe Integration (requires backend)
- Use Stripe test card numbers:
  - Success: 4242424242424242
  - Decline: 4000000000000002
  - Insufficient funds: 4000000000009995

## Stripe Test Cards

For testing purposes, use these test card numbers:

| Number | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 4242424242424242 | Visa - Success |
| 4000000000000002 | Visa - Decline |
| 5555555555554444 | Mastercard - Success |
| 4000000000009995 | Visa - Insufficient funds |
| 4000000000000069 | Visa - Expired card |

## Integration Notes

### Security Considerations
- All payment data encrypted in transit
- PCI DSS compliance through Stripe
- Row Level Security (RLS) on payment_methods table
- No sensitive card data stored locally

### Error Handling
- Network connectivity issues
- Payment processing failures
- Invalid card data
- Expired cards
- Insufficient funds

### UI/UX Improvements
- Loading states during payment processing
- Clear error messages
- Success confirmations
- Professional payment form styling
- Card brand detection and icons

## Production Deployment

### Before Going Live:
1. Replace test Stripe keys with live keys
2. Implement proper backend endpoints
3. Add comprehensive error logging
4. Set up payment failure monitoring
5. Configure webhook handlers for payment events
6. Add PCI compliance documentation

### Monitoring & Analytics:
- Track payment success rates
- Monitor failed payment reasons
- Log payment method usage patterns
- Set up alerts for payment issues

This implementation provides a solid foundation for real payment processing while maintaining security and user experience best practices.
