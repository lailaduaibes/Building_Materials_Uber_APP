```

#### **3. `vehicle_inspections` - Safety Compliance**
```sql
- Inspection dates and results

  verified_by: "admin-user-id",
  verified_at: new Date(),
  rejection_reason: null, // if rejected
  admin_notes: "All documents verified successfully"

```

### **Step 4: Vehicle Assignment**
```javascript
// System assigns approved vehicle to driver
const assignment = {
  truck_id: "vehicle-id",
  driver_id: "driver-user-id", 
  assigned_by: "admin-user-id",
  assignment_start: new Date(),
  status: "active"

    const vehicle = await supabase
      .from('trucks')
      .insert({
        ...vehicleData,
        owner_driver_id: driverId,
        verification_status: 'pending'
      })
    
    // Notify admin for review
    await this.notifyAdminForReview(vehicle.id)
    
    return vehicle
  }
  
  // Admin verifies vehicle
  async verifyVehicle(vehicleId: string, adminId: string, approved: boolean) {
    const status = approved ? 'approved' : 'rejected'
    
    await supabase
      .from('trucks')
      .update({
        verification_status: status,
        verified_by: adminId,
        verified_at: new Date()
      })
      .eq('id', vehicleId)
    
    // Notify driver of decision
    await this.notifyDriverOfDecision(vehicleId, status)
  }
  
  // Check trip compatibility with verified vehicle
  async checkVehicleCompatibility(driverId: string, tripRequirements: any) {
    const driverVehicles = await supabase
      .from('trucks')
      .select('*, truck_types(*)')
      .eq('owner_driver_id', driverId)
      .eq('verification_status', 'approved')
      .eq('is_available', true)
    
    return driverVehicles.some(vehicle => 
      vehicle.truck_types.name === tripRequirements.required_truck_type
    )
  }
}
```
