NOTES & CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

Current Platform Strengths:
✅ Solid database architecture with proper relationships
✅ Professional UI/UX design across both apps
✅ Comprehensive authentication and registration system
✅ Real-time location tracking and mapping
✅ Admin dashboard with driver approval workflow
✅ Well-structured codebase with TypeScript

Architecture Decisions Made:
- Supabase for backend (PostgreSQL + real-time)
- React Native + Expo for mobile apps
- HTML/JavaScript for admin dashboard
- Professional color themes (blue for customer, black/white for driver)

Technology Stack Validation:
- Database: PostgreSQL via Supabase ✅
- Authentication: Supabase Auth ✅
- Real-time: Supabase Realtime ✅
- Maps: React Native Maps + Google APIs ✅
- State Management: React Hooks ✅
- Styling: React Native StyleSheet ✅

This platform has a strong foundation and is closer to production than many
startups at similar stages. The main work is integrating third-party services
and adding the final polish for production deployment.
