‚úÖ Professional UI/UX design across both apps
‚úÖ Comprehensive authentication and registration system
‚úÖ Real-time location tracking and mapping
‚úÖ Admin dashboard with driver approval workflow
‚úÖ Well-structured codebase with TypeScript

Architecture Decisions Made:
- Supabase for backend (PostgreSQL + real-time)
- React Native + Expo for mobile apps
- HTML/JavaScript for admin dashboard
- Professional color themes (blue for customer, black/white for driver)

Technology Stack Validation:
- Database: PostgreSQL via Supabase ‚úÖ
- Authentication: Supabase Auth ‚úÖ
- Real-time: Supabase Realtime ‚úÖ
- Maps: React Native Maps + Google APIs ‚úÖ
- State Management: React Hooks ‚úÖ
- Styling: React Native StyleSheet ‚úÖ

This platform has a strong foundation and is closer to production than many
startups at similar stages. The main work is integrating third-party services
and adding the final polish for production deployment.
