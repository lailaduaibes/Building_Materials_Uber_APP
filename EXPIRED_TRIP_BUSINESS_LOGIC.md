# What Happens When a Trip Expires? 🕐

## Business Impact & Customer Experience

### 1. **Immediate Actions** ⚡
When a trip expires, the system should automatically:

#### Customer Notification
- **Push notification**: "Your delivery request has expired"
- **SMS/Email**: Explain why it expired and suggest next steps
- **In-app message**: Show in customer's order history with clear status

#### Admin/Dispatcher Alert
- **Dashboard notification**: "X trips expired in last hour"
- **Analytics update**: Track expiration reasons and patterns
- **Driver availability review**: Check if we need more drivers

### 2. **Customer Communication** 📱

#### For ASAP Trips (expired due to no drivers)
```
"We couldn't find available drivers for your immediate delivery request.

What happened: No drivers were available in your area
Material: [material_type]
Time attempted: [time_range]

Options:
• Try again now (if more drivers online)
• Schedule for a specific time
• Contact support for help

We're sorry for the inconvenience!"
```

#### For Scheduled Trips (expired due to time passed)
```
"Your scheduled delivery time has passed.

Scheduled for: [date/time]
Material: [material_type]
Status: Expired (no driver assigned)

Options:
• Create a new delivery request
• Contact support if you need help

Thank you for using YouMats!"
```

### 3. **Technical Actions** ⚙️

#### Database Updates
- ✅ Set `status = 'expired'`
- ✅ Record expiration timestamp
- ✅ Create notification record
- ✅ Update analytics/metrics

#### App Behavior
- **Customer App**: Show expired status in order history
- **Driver App**: Remove from available trips list
- **Admin Dashboard**: Show in expired trips report

#### Analytics Tracking
- Track expiration rate by time of day
- Monitor ASAP vs scheduled expiration patterns
- Identify areas with driver shortage

### 4. **Business Intelligence** 📊

#### Metrics to Track
```sql
-- Daily expiration metrics
SELECT 
    DATE(created_at) as date,
    pickup_time_preference,
    COUNT(*) as expired_count,
    AVG(quoted_price) as avg_value_lost,
    STRING_AGG(DISTINCT material_type, ', ') as materials_affected
FROM trip_requests 
WHERE status = 'expired'
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at), pickup_time_preference
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

#### Business Actions Based on Patterns
- **High ASAP expirations** → Recruit more drivers
- **Specific area patterns** → Target driver recruitment
- **Time-based patterns** → Adjust driver incentives
- **Material-specific issues** → Review truck/equipment availability

### 5. **Recovery Actions** 🔄

#### Automatic Re-engagement
- **Smart retry suggestions**: "Try scheduling for [suggested_time] when more drivers are available"
- **Alternative options**: "Consider [alternative_material] which has better availability"
- **Incentive offers**: "Get 10% off your next scheduled delivery"

#### Customer Retention
- Follow up with customers who had multiple expirations
- Offer priority booking or premium service
- Provide better time estimates and availability info

### 6. **Prevention Strategies** 🛡️
