# Enhanced Map View with Country & City Selection - FIXED

## 🎯 Issue Resolved: Country/City Selection Not Opening

### Problem:
- Users clicking on country/city selection buttons but modals not opening

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Country/City Selection Still Not Working:

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for "Country picker pressed" or "City picker pressed" in console
2. **Verify Import**: Ensure you're using `LocationPickerEnhanced` not `LocationPicker`
3. **Modal Conflicts**: Make sure no other modals are open simultaneously
4. **Touch Events**: Check if TouchableOpacity has proper `onPress` handlers

### Testing Steps:
1. Open location picker
2. Tap country button (should see console log)
3. Tap city button (should see console log)
4. Verify modal content switches properly
5. Test back navigation

### Debug Code:
```typescript
// Add to component for debugging
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('Picker mode changed to:', pickerMode);
}, [pickerMode]);
```

### Common Issues:
- **Modal not opening**: Check if `showPicker` state is properly managed
- **Buttons not responding**: Verify TouchableOpacity isn't disabled
- **Mode not switching**: Check `setPickerMode` calls in onPress handlers
- **Back button not working**: Verify arrow-back icon and onPress handler
