# 🔍 **Trip Disappearance Issue - SOLVED** 

## 🚨 **Root Cause Found**

Your debug output revealed the exact problem:

**All trips have `acceptance_deadline: null`** instead of proper timestamps!

## 📊 **The Evidence**

- ✅ **6 pending trips** exist that should be visible
- ❌ **0 trips** pass the `acceptance_deadline > NOW()` filter  
- 🔍 **All trips** show `"acceptance_deadline": null`

## 🛠️ **Complete Solution Implemented**

### **1. Immediate Fix (Run This SQL)**
Execute: `fix-missing-acceptance-deadlines.sql`

This will:
- Set proper acceptance deadlines for existing pending trips
- Add a database trigger to auto-set deadlines for future trips
- Clean up expired trips properly

### **2. Enhanced Driver Service**
- ✅ Added NULL acceptance_deadline handling
- ✅ Updated queries to filter out NULL deadlines
- ✅ Enhanced debugging to catch this issue

### **3. Database Trigger Added**
```sql
-- Auto-sets acceptance_deadline for new trips:
-- ASAP trips: 3 minutes
-- Scheduled trips: 15 minutes
```

## 🎯 **Expected Results After Fix**

**Before Fix:**
```
pending_trips: 6
visible_to_drivers: 0  ← The problem
```

**After Fix:**
```
pending_trips: X
visible_to_drivers: Y  ← Should match pending trips (or less if some expired)
```

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Run the fix**: Execute `fix-missing-acceptance-deadlines.sql`
2. **Test driver app**: Open driver app - you should now see available trips
3. **Monitor logs**: Check for the debugging output we added

## 🔄 **Prevention**

The database trigger will ensure all future trips automatically get proper acceptance deadlines, preventing this issue from recurring.

**Your trips weren't actually disappearing - they were just being filtered out due to NULL acceptance deadlines!**
