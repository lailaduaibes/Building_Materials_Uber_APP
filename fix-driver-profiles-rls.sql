-- Fix RLS policies for driver_profiles table
-- The issue: During registration, auth.uid() might be NULL or not match user_id yet
-- This prevents driver profile creation during the registration process

-- Enable RLS on driver_profiles if not already enabled
ALTER TABLE driver_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop ALL existing policies to start fresh
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Drivers can manage own profile" ON driver_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Drivers can view own profile" ON driver_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role access driver profiles" ON driver_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can read driver profiles" ON driver_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "drivers_can_insert_profile" ON driver_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "drivers_can_read_own_profile" ON driver_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "drivers_can_update_own_profile" ON driver_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "service_role_full_access" ON driver_profiles;

-- NEW APPROACH: Allow driver registration to work
-- 1. Allow INSERT for anyone (registration process needs this)
CREATE POLICY "allow_driver_profile_registration" ON driver_profiles
    FOR INSERT 
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- 2. Allow users to read their own profile once authenticated
CREATE POLICY "drivers_read_own_profile" ON driver_profiles
    FOR SELECT 
    USING (auth.uid() = user_id OR auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'service_role');

-- 3. Allow users to update their own profile
CREATE POLICY "drivers_update_own_profile" ON driver_profiles
    FOR UPDATE 
    USING (auth.uid() = user_id OR auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'service_role')
    WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id OR auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'service_role');

-- 4. Service role full access (for admin operations)
CREATE POLICY "service_role_full_access" ON driver_profiles
    FOR ALL 
    USING (auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'service_role');

-- Grant necessary permissions
GRANT ALL ON driver_profiles TO authenticated;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO authenticated;

-- Test the fix by trying to create a driver profile
