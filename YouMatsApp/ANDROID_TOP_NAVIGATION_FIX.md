# Android Top Navigation Responsiveness Fix

## Issue Description
The top navigation bar containing "You're online/offline" status and the online toggle button was being cut off on Android devices, appearing partially outside the screen border.

## Root Cause
The issue occurred because:
1. Android handles status bar differently than iOS
2. The SafeAreaView behavior differs between platforms
3. No explicit padding was added for Android's status bar height

## Solution Applied

### 1. Dynamic Status Bar Height Calculation
Added a function to calculate the proper status bar height for Android:

```typescript
const getStatusBarHeight = () => {
  if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
    return StatusBar.currentHeight || 24; // Fallback to 24 if undefined
  }
  return 0; // iOS handles this through SafeAreaView
};
```

### 2. Dynamic Container Padding
Applied dynamic padding to the main container:

```typescript
<SafeAreaView style={[styles.container, { paddingTop: getStatusBarHeight() }]}>
```

### 3. Platform-Specific Approach
- **Android**: Explicitly adds status bar height as top padding
- **iOS**: Relies on SafeAreaView's built-in behavior
- **Fallback**: Uses 24px if StatusBar.currentHeight is unavailable

## Benefits

✅ **Proper Status Bar Handling**: Top navigation no longer gets cut off
✅ **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works correctly on both Android and iOS
✅ **Dynamic Adjustment**: Adapts to different Android device status bar heights
✅ **Fallback Protection**: Uses safe fallback if StatusBar.currentHeight is undefined
✅ **Responsive Design**: Maintains responsive behavior across device sizes

## Testing Recommendations

After applying this fix, test on:

1. **Android Devices**:
   - Various screen sizes (small phones to large phones)
   - Different Android versions (status bar heights may vary)
   - Devices with notches or different status bar configurations

2. **iOS Devices**:
   - Verify SafeAreaView still works correctly
   - Test on devices with and without notches

3. **Key Elements to Verify**:
   - ✅ "You're online/offline" text is fully visible
   - ✅ Online/Offline toggle button is fully accessible
   - ✅ Menu button (hamburger) is properly positioned
   - ✅ No overlap with device status bar
   - ✅ Proper spacing and alignment

## Technical Notes

- Uses `StatusBar.currentHeight` for precise Android status bar measurement
- Maintains existing responsive design with `getResponsiveValue()` functions
- Does not affect iOS behavior (continues using SafeAreaView)
- Provides graceful fallback for edge cases

## Related Files Modified
