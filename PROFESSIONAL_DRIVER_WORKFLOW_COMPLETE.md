# Professional Driver Application & Approval System

## Current System Status ✅

**Driver App:** Direct connection to Supabase (PostgreSQL database)
**Backend:** Optional Node.js API for complex operations (not needed for basic driver workflow)
**Authentication:** Supabase Auth with JWT tokens

## Professional Driver Workflow 

### Phase 1: Driver Self-Registration 📱
**What drivers do:**
1. **Download app** and create account with email/password
2. **Fill out application** with:
   - Personal information (name, phone, address)
   - Driver license details and expiry date
   - Years of experience driving commercial vehicles
   - Specializations (heavy materials, construction equipment, etc.)
   - Vehicle information (if providing own vehicle)
3. **Upload required documents:**
   - Driver's license photo (front/back)
   - Vehicle registration
   - Insurance certificate 
   - Vehicle inspection certificate
   - Any special certifications (CDL, hazmat, etc.)
4. **Submit application** for admin review

**Status:** `pending` → `under_review`

### Phase 2: Admin Review & Decision 👩‍💼
**What admins do:**
1. **Receive notification** of new driver application
2. **Review submitted information:**
   - Verify personal details
   - Check driver license validity and expiry
   - Validate insurance coverage
   - Review experience and qualifications
3. **Document verification:**
   - Confirm uploaded documents are clear and valid
   - Check document expiry dates
   - Verify vehicle registration matches provided info
4. **Background checks** (if required):
   - Driving record check
   - Criminal background check
   - Employment verification
5. **Make decision:**
   - ✅ **APPROVE:** Driver can start accepting trips
   - ❌ **REJECT:** Driver receives specific reason and can reapply
   - ⏳ **REQUEST MORE INFO:** Ask for additional documents or clarification

**Admin controls:**
- Approval/rejection with detailed notes
- Document verification status
- Driver performance monitoring
- Vehicle compliance tracking

### Phase 3: Active Driver Management 🚛
**Ongoing responsibilities:**
1. **Performance monitoring:**
   - Customer feedback and ratings
   - Trip completion rates
   - Safety incidents
2. **Compliance management:**
   - Insurance renewal reminders
   - Vehicle inspection schedules
   - License expiry tracking
3. **Fleet optimization:**
   - Vehicle assignment for optimal routes
   - Driver availability management
   - Specialization matching with customer needs

## Current Database Structure

### Existing Tables ✅
```sql
driver_profiles:
├── id (UUID)
├── user_id (UUID) → auth.users
├── first_name, last_name, phone
├── years_experience
├── specializations (JSONB)
├── rating, total_trips, total_earnings
├── status ('online', 'offline', 'busy')
├── vehicle_plate, vehicle_model
├── created_at, updated_at
└── [Missing approval fields]

trucks:
├── id (UUID)
├── license_plate, make, model, year
├── truck_type, is_available
├── current_driver_id → driver_profiles
└── verification_status
```

### Missing for Professional Workflow ❌
```sql
-- Need to add to driver_profiles:
├── is_approved (BOOLEAN)
├── verification_status ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected')
├── application_submitted_at (TIMESTAMP)
├── approved_at (TIMESTAMP)
├── approved_by (UUID) → admin users
├── rejection_reason (TEXT)
└── admin_notes (TEXT)

-- New tables needed:
driver_applications (full application details)
driver_documents (uploaded files with verification status)
vehicle_verifications (document verification tracking)
```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Database Schema Updates 🗄️
Add approval fields to existing `driver_profiles` table:
```sql
ALTER TABLE driver_profiles
ADD COLUMN is_approved BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
ADD COLUMN verification_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending',
ADD COLUMN application_submitted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
ADD COLUMN approved_at TIMESTAMP,
ADD COLUMN approved_by UUID,
ADD COLUMN rejection_reason TEXT,
ADD COLUMN admin_notes TEXT;
```

### Step 2: Driver App Features 📱
1. **Registration flow** with document upload
2. **Application status** tracking screen
3. **Document management** for renewals
4. **Notification system** for status updates

### Step 3: Admin Dashboard 💻
