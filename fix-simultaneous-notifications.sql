-- üö® CRITICAL FIX: Stop simultaneous driver notifications

-- The issue is clear: trips are reaching multiple drivers simultaneously 
-- because there's a mechanism bypassing the queue system.

-- Step 1: Identify the exact mechanism causing simultaneous notifications
-- Check if trips are being inserted with assigned_driver_id already set
-- or if there's a global notification trigger

-- Check recent trip creation pattern
