# 🌟 Rating System Implementation Summary

## Database Structure Analysis
Based on the SQL queries, your database already has the rating fields:

### **Main Tables with Rating Fields:**
- ✅ `trip_requests` - Has `customer_rating`, `driver_rating`, `customer_feedback`, `driver_feedback`  
- ✅ `driver_profiles` - Has overall `rating` (numeric, default 0.00)
- ✅ Rating constraints: 1-5 stars (CHECK constraints verified)

### **Current Status:**
- 📊 **8 completed trips** with no ratings yet  
- 🚗 **5 drivers** with manual ratings (4.80-5.00)
- 💡 **Perfect opportunity** to implement rating system!
