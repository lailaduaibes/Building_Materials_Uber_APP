-- üîç DEBUG: Driver Availability Issue Analysis
-- Issue: start_asap_matching returns "No available drivers found" but trip reaches driver app

-- 1. Check current driver profiles and their availability status
SELECT

    dp.status as profile_status,
    dp.is_available,
    dp.is_approved,
    dp.vehicle_type,
    dp.created_at,
    dp.updated_at
FROM driver_profiles dp
ORDER BY dp.updated_at DESC

-- 2. Check what criteria start_asap_matching_sequential uses for "available drivers"
-- This should match the find_nearby_available_drivers function criteria
SELECT '=== CHECKING FUNCTION DEFINITIONS ===' as section;

-- Check if the function exists and its definition
SELECT

-- 3. Test the actual criteria that find_nearby_available_drivers uses
-- Based on common patterns, it likely checks:
-- - dp.is_available = true
-- - dp.is_approved = true (or dp.status = 'approved')
-- - Maybe location requirements

    pickup_longitude,
    status,
    assigned_driver_id,

-- 6. Check if there are any specific constraints in asap_driver_queue
SELECT 
    '=== ASAP QUEUE STATUS ===' as section,

-- 7. Final analysis - combine everything to find the mismatch
SELECT
