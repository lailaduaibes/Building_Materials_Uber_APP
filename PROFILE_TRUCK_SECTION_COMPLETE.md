# TRUCK INFORMATION ADDED TO DRIVER PROFILE ✅

## 🎯 **What Was Added**

### **New Profile Section: Fleet Assignment**
The driver profile now shows **actual truck data** from the fleet instead of just registration details!

### **Features Added:**

#### **1. Enhanced Vehicle Information Section**
- **Registration Details:** Shows original registration info (model, year, plate)
- **Fleet Assignment:** Shows actual trucks assigned to the driver from the fleet

#### **2. Real Truck Data Display**
For each assigned truck, the profile shows:
- ✅ **Truck Type Name** (including custom types created during approval)
- ✅ **Vehicle Details** (make, model, year) 
- ✅ **License Plate**
- ✅ **Max Payload** capacity in tons
- ✅ **Max Volume** capacity in cubic meters
- ✅ **Truck Description** (if available)
- ✅ **Status Badge** (Available/In Use)

#### **3. Smart Data Loading**
- Automatically loads truck data when profile opens
- Refreshes truck data when profile is reloaded
- Shows "No trucks assigned yet" for pending drivers

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **New DriverService Method:**
```typescript
// Gets full truck details from the fleet
async getDriverTruckDetails(): Promise<any[]> {
  // Queries trucks table with current_driver_id
  // Includes truck_types join for full information
}
```

### **Enhanced Profile Screen:**
- Added truck data state management
- Enhanced `renderVehicleInfo()` with fleet section
- Added styles for truck cards and status badges
- Auto-refreshes truck data with profile

### **Database Integration:**
- Reads from actual `trucks` table (not mockup data)
- Shows trucks created by the approval trigger
- Displays real capacity values from driver registration

## 🧪 **How to Test**

1. **Login to approved driver account** (Laila Duaibes)
2. **Navigate to Profile/Settings**
3. **Look for "Vehicle Information" section**
4. **Should see two subsections:**
   - **Registration Details** (original registration info)
   - **Fleet Assignment** (actual truck from fleet)

## ✅ **Expected Result**

**Driver Profile will now display:**
- ✅ Custom truck type created during approval
- ✅ Actual vehicle capacity (not 5.0/10.0 defaults)  
- ✅ Real truck assignment from fleet
- ✅ Current availability status
- ✅ Complete truck specifications

**Example Display:**
