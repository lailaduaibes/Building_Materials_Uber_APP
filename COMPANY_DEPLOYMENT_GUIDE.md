# 🏢 Company Deployment Guide - Payment System Ready

## Overview
The payment system has been **fully implemented** and is ready for your company's deployment. All code is complete - the company just needs to configure their payment processor credentials and deploy.

## ✅ What's Already Implemented

### Complete Payment Infrastructure
- **Database Schema**: Full payment tables, security policies, and analytics
- **Backend Services**: Secure payment processing with Supabase Edge Functions
- **Mobile App UI**: Professional payment screens integrated into customer app
- **Security**: PCI-compliant architecture with proper data isolation
- **User Experience**: Seamless 5-step booking flow with payment integration

## 🔧 Company Configuration Required

### 1. Payment Processor Setup
The company needs to configure their payment processor. The system supports:

**Stripe (Recommended)**
```bash
# Production Environment Variables
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_[company_stripe_secret_key]
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_[company_stripe_publishable_key]
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_[company_webhook_secret]
```

**Alternative Payment Processors**
- The edge function can be modified to support other processors
- PayPal, Square, or custom payment gateways
- Same UI components work with any backend processor

### 2. Environment Configuration

**Backend (.env)**
```bash
# Payment Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=[company_stripe_secret_key]
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=[company_webhook_secret]

# Supabase (Already Configured)
SUPABASE_URL=https://pjbbtmuhlpscmrbgsyzb.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[service_role_key]
```

**Customer App (.env)**
```bash
# Payment Configuration  
EXPO_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=[company_stripe_publishable_key]

# Supabase (Already Configured)
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://pjbbtmuhlpscmrbgsyzb.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[anon_key]
```

### 3. Stripe Account Setup (If Using Stripe)

**What the Company Needs to Do:**
1. **Create Stripe Account**: Sign up at https://stripe.com
2. **Business Verification**: Complete Stripe's business verification process
3. **Get API Keys**: 
   - Go to Stripe Dashboard → Developers → API Keys
   - Copy the publishable key (starts with `pk_live_`)
   - Copy the secret key (starts with `sk_live_`)
4. **Configure Webhooks**:
   - Set webhook URL to: `https://[your-supabase-url]/functions/v1/payment-processor`
   - Enable events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`

## 🚀 Deployment Process

### Step 1: Configure Payment Processor
```bash
# Company adds their Stripe keys to environment
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxxxx
EXPO_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_xxxxx
```

### Step 2: Deploy Backend
```bash
cd "Building Materials Uber App"
npm run deploy  # Deploys with company's payment configuration
```

### Step 3: Deploy Mobile App
```bash
cd CustomerAppNew
expo build:android  # or ios
# Deploy to app stores with company branding
```

### Step 4: Test Payment Flow
1. Test with Stripe test cards in staging environment
2. Process small live transaction to verify setup
3. Monitor Stripe dashboard for successful payments
