# Chat and Customer Information Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Customer Information Display
**Problem**: Driver app showed generic "Customer" instead of real customer names
**Solution**: 
- Updated `getAvailableTrips` query in DriverService to join with users table
- Added `users!trip_requests_customer_id_fkey (first_name, last_name, phone)` to both regular and service role queries
- Updated OrderAssignment mapping to use actual customer data: `customerName: trip.users ? \`${trip.users.first_name || ''} ${trip.users.last_name || ''}\`.trim() || 'Customer' : 'Customer'`
- Added customer phone number mapping: `customerPhone: trip.users?.phone || ''`

### 2. Professional Chat Interface
**Problem**: Chat interface was not professional and missing customer context
**Solution**:
- **Enhanced Header**: Added professional customer profile section with avatar, name, and trip status
- **Customer Avatar**: Added circular avatar with person icon for visual consistency
- **Trip Status**: Shows "New Trip Request", "Trip Accepted", or "Active Trip" based on current status

### 3. Photo Display in Chat
**Problem**: Photos sent through chat were not appearing in conversation
**Solution**:
- Added photo rendering in `renderMessage` function
- Added `messagePhoto` style for proper image display (200x150px with rounded corners)
- Photos are clickable to view full size
- Uses `item.message_type === 'image'` and `item.image_url` (corrected from 'photo' type)

### 4. ETA Updates Display
**Problem**: ETA updates were not visually distinguished in chat
**Solution**:
- Enhanced ETA update badge with schedule icon and "ETA Update" label
- ETA messages properly identified by `message_type === 'eta_update'`
- DriverCommunicationService correctly creates ETA messages with proper type

### 5. Pickup Time Display in Trips
**Problem**: Driver app didn't show whether trips were ASAP or scheduled
**Solution**:
- Created `PickupTimeDisplay` component with professional blue theme
- Added component to trip cards in ModernDriverDashboard and ProfessionalDriverDashboard  
- Shows "ASAP" with flash icon for immediate trips
- Shows scheduled time with calendar icon for future pickups
- Added urgency detection (urgent, soon, normal) with appropriate colors

## Files Modified

## Database Schema Requirements

The improvements rely on:
- `trip_requests` table having `customer_id` foreign key to `users` table
- `users` table having `first_name`, `last_name`, `phone` fields
- `trip_messages` table supporting `message_type` field with 'eta_update', 'image' values
- `trip_requests` table having `pickup_time_preference` and `scheduled_pickup_time` fields
