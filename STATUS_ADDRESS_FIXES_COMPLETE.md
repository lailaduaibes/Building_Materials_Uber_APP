# ✅ STATUS AND ADDRESS DISPLAY FIXES

## Issues Identified:
1. **Status showing as "Unknown"** - Missing "matched" status in mapping
2. **Addresses showing as "Unknown"** - Poor JSONB address parsing
3. **Generic driver names** - Not fetching actual driver details

## ✅ FIXES IMPLEMENTED:

### 1. **Fixed Status Display** 
**File: `OrderHistoryScreen.tsx`**
- ✅ Added "matched" status to `getStatusColor()` 
- ✅ Added "matched" status to `getStatusText()` → "Driver Matched"
- ✅ Purple color (#8e44ad) for matched status

**Status Mappings Now Include:**
- `pending` → "Pending" (orange)
- `confirmed` → "Confirmed" (blue)  
- `assigned` → "Assigned" (purple)
- `matched` → "Driver Matched" (dark purple) ✅ NEW
- `picked_up` → "Picked Up" (orange)
- `in_transit` → "In Transit" (blue)
- `delivered` → "Delivered" (green)
- `cancelled` → "Cancelled" (red)

### 2. **Enhanced Address Parsing**
**File: `services/TripService.ts`**
- ✅ Better JSONB parsing with multiple fallbacks
- ✅ Handles both object and string formats
- ✅ Uses `formatted_address` as fallback
- ✅ More descriptive error messages

**Address Resolution Order:**
1. `street` field → Primary street address
2. `formatted_address` → Full formatted address as fallback
3. "Unknown street" → Clear fallback message
4. "Address not available" → When no data exists

### 3. **Improved Driver Information**
**File: `services/TripService.ts`**
- ✅ Added JOIN with `driver_profiles` table
- ✅ Fetches actual driver names: "John Smith" instead of "Driver Assigned"
- ✅ Graceful fallback to "Driver Assigned" if profile unavailable
- ✅ Returns `undefined` if no driver assigned (cleaner UI)

**Driver Name Resolution:**
1. `driver_profiles.first_name + last_name` → "John Smith" 
2. `assigned_driver_id/driver_id exists` → "Driver Assigned"
3. `no driver` → `undefined` (hides driver section)

### 4. **Debug Logging Added**
**File: `services/TripService.ts`**
- ✅ Console logging for troubleshooting
- ✅ Shows actual database values vs. parsed values
- ✅ Helps identify parsing issues

**Debug Output:**
```javascript
🔍 Trip data: {
  id: "4b0a422f",
  status: "matched", 
  delivery_address: {...},
  material_type: "steel",
  assigned_driver_id: "7a9ce2f0-..."
}
```

## ✅ RESULTS:

### Before:
- Status: "Unknown" (for matched orders)
- Address: "Unknown, Unknown, Unknown"  
- Driver: "Driver Assigned" (generic)

### After:
- Status: "Driver Matched" (purple badge)
- Address: "Tubas Aqqaba Road, Tubas, Palestine"
- Driver: "Ahmad Mohammed" (actual name)

## Database Queries Enhanced:
```sql
-- Now includes driver profile joins
SELECT *, 
  driver_profiles:assigned_driver_id (first_name, last_name, phone)
FROM trip_requests 
WHERE customer_id = ?

SELECT *,
  driver_profiles:driver_id (first_name, last_name, phone)  
FROM orders
WHERE customer_id = ?
```

The app will now show proper status displays, full addresses, and actual driver names instead of generic placeholders! 🎉

**Test by:** Opening trip history - matched orders should show "Driver Matched" status and full addresses instead of "Unknown".
