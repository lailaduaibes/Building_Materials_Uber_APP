# 🚚 Trip Expiration System - Complete Guide

## 📋 Summary

You asked about handling expired trips, and you're absolutely right - during development, trips can remain unassigned and appear expired. Here's the complete solution I've implemented:

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before**: Drivers could see old trips from the past that should no longer be available for pickup.

**After**: The system automatically cleans up expired trips and prevents drivers from seeing stale requests.

## 🔧 How It Works

### **1. Two Types of Expiration**

#### **Type A: Acceptance Deadline Expired**
- **ASAP trips**: 3 minutes to accept
- **Scheduled trips**: 15 minutes to accept  
- **Purpose**: Ensures quick response times

#### **Type B: Scheduled Pickup Time Passed**
- **Grace period**: 2 hours after scheduled pickup time
- **Purpose**: Handles missed pickups and no-shows

### **2. Automatic Cleanup Process**

```typescript
// Called every time driver views available trips
await this.cleanupExpiredTrips();
```

### **3. Database Function**

```sql
-- Marks expired trips as 'expired' status
UPDATE trip_requests 
SET status = 'expired'
WHERE status = 'pending' 
AND acceptance_deadline < NOW();
```

### **4. Client-Side Filtering**

```sql
-- Only shows non-expired trips to drivers
WHERE status = 'pending' 
AND acceptance_deadline > NOW()
```

## 📊 Real-World Example

**Scenario**: It's Friday 3:00 PM, and you have these trips:

| Trip | Type | Scheduled Time | Accept Deadline | Status | Shown to Driver? |
|------|------|----------------|-----------------|--------|------------------|
| A | ASAP | - | 2:55 PM | pending | ❌ (5 min expired) |
| B | Scheduled | 4:00 PM | 3:10 PM | pending | ✅ (future pickup) |
| C | Scheduled | 12:00 PM | 12:15 PM | pending | ❌ (3h past pickup) |
| D | Scheduled | 3:30 PM | 3:15 PM | pending | ✅ (soon, not >2h past) |

**After cleanup runs**: Trips A and C become `status = 'expired'`

## 🚀 Implementation Status

### ✅ **Completed**
- [x] Database cleanup function
- [x] Client-side automatic cleanup
- [x] Smart acceptance deadlines (3min ASAP, 15min scheduled)
- [x] Query filtering to hide expired trips
- [x] Proper error handling

### 🔄 **How to Test**
1. Run the test script: `test-trip-expiration-system.sql`
2. Open driver app - old trips should not appear
3. Create a test trip and wait for deadline to pass

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can adjust the timing in `DriverService.ts`:

```typescript
private calculateAcceptDeadline(pickupTimePreference?: string): string {
  if (pickupTimePreference === 'asap') {
    return new Date(now + 3 * 60 * 1000).toISOString(); // 3 minutes
  } else {
    return new Date(now + 15 * 60 * 1000).toISOString(); // 15 minutes
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Your Original Question Answered

> "I have a trip in the past but still shown as accept trip"

**Solution**: The system now automatically:
1. ✅ Cleans up expired trips before showing the list
2. ✅ Filters out trips past their acceptance deadline  
3. ✅ Handles both ASAP and scheduled trip expiration
4. ✅ Gives appropriate grace periods for real-world usage

**Result**: Drivers will only see trips that are actually available and not expired!

## 🧪 Testing

Run this to test: `test-trip-expiration-system.sql`

This will show you exactly what trips are active vs expired in your system.
